#===============================================================================
# This file will break the HSC-TF catalog into chunks and download them using
# the batch download feature from the HSC database. It will then extract and
# rename them, placing them in a dir called "images"
#
# There are a few things to be aware of:
# 1. update the creds dictionary in the download_file() function with your
#    username and password
# 2. If you want to only process part of the chunks change the start and end
#    variables in the main() function other wise you will process all ~106
#    chunks
# 3. The download is parallelized to 2 processes. I get 503 errors if I try to
#    to add another stream. The renaming will parallelize upto all available
#    processors so add an argument if you want to limit that
# 4. Downloading each file took about ~20 minutes on my desktop at the
#    university YMMV
# 5. The script expects the catalog to be in the same dir as the script, change
#    make_hsc_lists() if thats not the case
